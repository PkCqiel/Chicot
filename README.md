# Chicot's Joust

Featuring 30 jokers, 28 of those based on Boss Blinds that become available after defeating their associated Boss.

Otherwise, there are other ways of finding Boss Jokers during a run:
- Boss Joker Packs can be found in shops and through a skip tag
- The new Champion's Deck will reward you with a defeated Boss Blind's Boss Joker
- A new spectral card to Summon increasingly stronger Boss Jokers in exchange for effort and sacrifice

My first take on a themed mod, still got things to do like rework a couple of jokers I'm not happy with and use lua hooks instead of lovely injections, but I wanted to leave this out already.

For now most assets are reused from base game, 
those done by myself are derivative from base game as well with a couple exceptions, even if none are final:
    Champion's deck color palette is based on the ace of cups from @Gracosef's spanish suited deck
    Normal Boss Joker Pack's ribbon/banner thingy is copied from Yahimod pack
